# About

BF_checkers.py checks if a BF(Boolean function) is an EF (Effective function), UF (Unate function), CF (Canalyzing function) or NCF (Nested canalyzing function).

BF_generator.py generates all BFs belogning to a particular type of BF: EF, UF, CF and NCF.

BF_properties.py is used to get various aspects of BFs such as average sensitivity, neighbors of each vertex of the hypercube, it's isomorphisms, dnf or cnf expressions (both 'full' and 'Quine-McCluskey minimized' expressions) and canalyzing depth.
