In this repository we provide codes to study certain types of biologically meaningful Boolean functions, namely: read-once functions (RoFs) and the nested canalyzing functions (NCFs). The other types of biologically meaningful functions are EF (Effective function), UF (Unate function) and CF (Canalyzing function).

We compute two complexity measures of Boolean functions: Boolean complexity and average senetivity; the program to compute them is given in the Boolean complexity folder and  BF_codes folder respectively.

### Bias vs Boolean complexity vs Average sensitivity
Below is a plot of the variation of the average sensitivity and Boolean complexity of 4-input 'representative' Boolean functions with the bias. Number of isomorphic functions are the number of functions which can be obtained by permutation and negation of the input variables of the Boolean function.
