### BF_codes 
The checkers (BF_checkers.py) and generators (BF_generators.py) of the different types of BFs are given in this folder. BF_properties are the codes to get some properties fo BFs and perform various operations on them. 

### Boolean_complexity
The procedure to compute the Boolean Complexity is given in this folder. 

### RoF
The code to check if a BF is an RoF, and to generate the representative RoFs are given here. The RoF_catalog list all the representative RoFs and their various properties upto 10 inputs. 

### biological_dataset
This folder contains the reference_biological_dataset.tsv file which contains details of the 2687 Boolean functions contained in 88 Boolean models obtained from various sources. It also contains the statistical_tests.R file which is used to compute the *p*-values to show enrichment of different types of BFs.
