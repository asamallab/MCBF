This repository contains 4 folders which are described below.

### 1. BF_codes 
The folder contains codes to check (BF_checkers.py) and generate (BF_generators.py) different types of biologically meaningful BFs. The code (BF_properties.py) enables computations of some properties of BFs and perform various operations on them. 

### 2. Boolean_complexity
The procedure to compute the Boolean Complexity of a given BF is provided in this folder. 

### RoF
The code to check if a BF is an RoF, and to generate the representative RoFs are given here. The RoF_catalog list all the representative RoFs and their various properties upto 10 inputs. 

### biological_dataset
This folder contains the reference_biological_dataset.tsv file which contains details of the 2687 Boolean functions contained in 88 Boolean models obtained from various sources. It also contains the statistical_tests.R file which is used to compute the *p*-values to show enrichment of different types of BFs.
