### BF_codes 
The checkers (BF_checkers.py) and generators (BF_generators.py) of the different types of BFs are given in this folder. BF_properties are the codes to get some properties fo BFs and perform various operations on them. 

### Boolean_complexity
The procedure to compute the Boolean Complexity is given in this folder. 

### RoF
The code to check if a BF is an RoF, and to generate the representative RoFs are given here. The RoF_catalog list all the representative RoFs and their various properties upto 10 inputs. 

In case you use the codes or data or catalog herein, please cite the reference given below:
