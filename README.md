## About

In this repository we provide codes to study certain types of biologically meaningful Boolean functions, namely: read-once functions (RoFs) and the nested canalyzing functions (NCFs). The other types of biologically meaningful functions are EF (Effective function), UF (Unate function) and CF (Canalyzing function).

We compute two complexity measures of Boolean functions: Boolean complexity and average senetivity; the program to compute them is given in the Boolean complexity folder and  BF_codes folder respectively.

In case you use the codes or data or catalog herein, please cite the reference given below:
